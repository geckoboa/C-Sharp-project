FormGallery.cs is used to generate the home screen. After selecting a directory using the search button, certain data appears within a control called ListView. When the user has selected the desired directory, he selects the button of the same name for the image slideshow. FormSlideshow.cs is then launched, for the slide show. The Directory.GetFiles method is used to retrieve images from the selected directory. To start the slide show, the user needs to check the Start Slide Show checkbox. The slide show speed can be adjusted with radio buttons called Slower slide and Fast slide.
